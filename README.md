# Customer Sentiment Analysis Project  

## Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze customer sentiments based on product reviews collected from Flipkart.com. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the project focuses on identifying customer sentiment as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**. The insights generated can help businesses understand customer feedback, improve their services, and make data-driven decisions for product development and marketing strategies.

### Features  

| Column         | Description                                                                                     |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Product_name` | Name of the product reviewed.                                                                   |
| `Product_price`| Price of the product.                                                                           |
| `Rate`         | Customer's rating of the product (on a scale of 1 to 5).                                        |
| `Review`       | Text of the customer's review for each product.                                                 |
| `Summary`      | Descriptive summary of the customer's thoughts about the product.                               |
| `Sentiment`    | Multiclass label for sentiment: **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** (derived from Summary). |

### Data Cleaning  
- Missing values in the `Review` column are handled, and `NaN` values are included for products with no review but an available `Summary`.  
- Data cleaning was performed using Python's `NumPy` and `Pandas` libraries.  
- Sentiment labeling was conducted using the **VADER model** and manually validated for accuracy.  

### Data Collection  
The dataset was obtained via **web scraping** using the `BeautifulSoup` library from Flipkart.com in December 2022.

## Methodology  

### 1. **Data Understanding**  
   - Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and trends in the data.  
   - Assess data quality and identify missing or inconsistent values.  

### 2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
   - Normalize textual data and preprocess reviews for modeling (tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization).  
   - Split data into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets.  

### 3. **Modeling**  
   - **Baseline Models:** Use models like Naive Bayes for initial benchmarking.  
   - **Advanced Models:** Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.  
   - **Deep Learning Models:** Implement LSTMs or Transformers (e.g., BERT) for advanced text analysis.  

### 4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
   - Visualize confusion matrices and ROC curves for better understanding.
